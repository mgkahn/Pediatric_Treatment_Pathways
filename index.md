### [Asthma Capped, Greater Than Ten](./Asthma_Capped_greaterThanTen.html)

<hr/>

Publicly viewable pages based on a GitHub repo can go in the gh-pages 
branch, or in the master branch, from master:/ or from master:/doc.

This is using master:/

Whichever way you prefer, it needs to be set up in settings for the repo. 
I don't have permission as a collaborator to change the settings on 
github.com/mgkahn/Pediatric_Treatment_Pathways. So I forked it to my 
own account to demonstrate.
