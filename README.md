### [README on github.io (gh-pages) site](http://mgkahn.github.io/Pediatric_Treatment_Pathways)

Publicly viewable pages based on a GitHub repo can go in the gh-pages 
branch, or in the master branch, from master:/ or from master:/doc.

This is using master:/

Whichever way you prefer, it needs to be set up in settings for the repo. 
I don't have permission as a collaborator to change the settings on 
github.com/mgkahn/Pediatric_Treatment_Pathways. So I forked it to my 
own account to demonstrate.

## Some instructions from GitHub on using GitHub Pages and Markdown

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/mgkahn/Pediatric_Treatment_Pathways/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/mgkahn/Pediatric_Treatment_Pathways/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
